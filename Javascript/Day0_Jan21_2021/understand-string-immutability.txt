/* In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
For example, the following code:
var myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
cannot change the value of myStr to "Job", because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. 
 */
// Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line
myStr = "Hello World"; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line
