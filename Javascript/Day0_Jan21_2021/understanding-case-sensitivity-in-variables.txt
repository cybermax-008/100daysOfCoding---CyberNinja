/* In Javascript, all variables and function names are case sensitive. 'MYVAR' is not same as 'MyVar' nor 'myvar'. Best practive of writing variables are using 'camelCase'. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is captalized. */
