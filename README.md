# 100daysOfCoding---CyberNinja
*"There is nothing that can't be done if you put enough time and effort. Believe It!"*
## Motivation and Commitment
This is part of Alexander Kallaway's [100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code "the official repo") challenge. More details about the challenge can be found here: [100daysofcode.com](http://100daysofcode.com/ "100daysofcode.com"). And, Thanks to [James Priest](https://james-priest.github.io) from whom i referred some ideas to schedule my productivtiy and docmentation layout.
**I WILL CODE FOR COMING 100 DAYS WITHOUT FAIL! BELIEVE IT**

### Day 5: January 27, 2021 - Wednesday

**Today's Project(s) :**
  - Python : CCC_2010 J1 and Element-wise arithematic ops for two lists
  - FCC : JS Basics track 
 **Progress:**
  - Problem J1: What is n, Daddy? CCC 2010.
  - Element-wise arithematic ops of two lists using List comprehension
  - Completed 101 to 109 in FCC: Javascript Basics track
